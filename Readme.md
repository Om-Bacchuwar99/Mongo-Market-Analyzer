### **MongoMarket Analyzer: Time-Series Data Pipeline for Microsoft Coorperation (MSFT)**





As a beginner i started complete Data Analytics project demonstrating the full pipeline from data sourcing to interactive visualization, using MongoDB for efficient storage and server-side aggregation.



##### 

##### 📊 Results and Visualization



The final output is an interactive Candlestick Chart for Microsoft (MSFT) overlaid with the 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA).







##### 🛠️ Tech Stack \& Key Skills



* Languages: Python
* Database: MongoDB (Time Series Collections, Aggregation Framework)
* Libraries: pandas, yfinance, pymongo, plotly
* Key Skills Demonstrated: Time-Series Analysis, Server-Side Aggregation (using $setWindowFields), Data Pipeline Engineering.







##### ⚙️ Project Workflow \& 📁Files



The project is structured into two main stages:



1.Data Ingestion (*ingest\_data.py*)



* Action: Downloads over four years of daily historical data for \*\*Microsoft (MSFT)\*\* using the `yfinance` library.
* Database Use: Stores the data in a dedicated \*\*MongoDB Time Series Collection\*\*, which is optimized for high-volume, time-stamped financial data.





2\. Analysis and Visualization (*analyze\_visualize.py*)



* Action: Queries the MongoDB collection.
* Aggregation: Utilizes the efficient MongoDB Aggregation Framework to calculate the 50-Day SMA directly within the database.
* Result: Generates and saves a high-quality, interactive Candlestick Chart using Plotly to visually compare the daily price against the calculated SMA.





3\. Screenshot of the MSFT Stock Candlestick Chart with 50-Day SMA (*msft\_analyzer\_chart\_static.png*)

* Static screenshot of the interactive visualization generated by Plotly.
